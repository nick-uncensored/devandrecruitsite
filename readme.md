#Dev And Recruit

### A means to stop letting recruiters profit from our value like we are a stock to trade.

> Dev And Recruit is in the early stages of creating a hub that can showcase the developers as individuals with seperate experiences 


#### The role of a recruiter today is to use non-professional methods that mimic "cold-calling" developers with no intention of researching the developers prior to connecting. Then after collecting a bunch of resumes, the recruiter hands them over to a company and collects a paycheck. Does this sound like 
 we are being sold as data?
